    <div class="card">
      <details>
        <summary>❓ Question 1: Which painting are we talking about?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            We are talking about the <strong>Mona Lisa</strong>, also known as
            <strong>La Joconde</strong>. It was painted by
            <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> in the early 16th century.
            The painting shows a woman with a calm expression and a mysterious,
            almost <em>enigmatic</em> smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            The model is believed to be <strong>Lisa del Giocondo</strong>, a
            Florentine woman. Today the Mona Lisa is displayed in the
            <strong>Louvre Museum in Paris</strong> and is one of the most
            famous works of art in the world.

      <details>
        <summary>❓ Question 2: What is the interesting story behind it?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            In <strong>1911</strong>, the Mona Lisa was
            <strong>stolen from the Louvre</strong>. A worker named
            <strong>Vincenzo Peruggia</strong> hid inside the museum,
            removed the painting from its frame, and walked out with it under his coat.
          </p>
          <p>
            For two years, nobody knew where the painting was. In 1913,
            Peruggia tried to sell it in Italy and was arrested. When the Mona Lisa
            returned to Paris, the scandal made it even more famous worldwide.

    <!-- Question 3: Systems Engineering -->
    <div class="card">
      <details>
        <summary>❓ Question 3: How can we describe it using systems engineering?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            In systems engineering, the Mona Lisa is not only a painting—it's the heart
            of a <strong>complex system</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <strong>mission</strong> is:
              “Allow visitors to see the Mona Lisa while keeping it safe for centuries.”
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong>stakeholders</strong> include:
              visitors, museum staff, conservators, security teams, the French state,
              and future generations.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong>technical architecture</strong> contains:
              a climate-controlled glass case, cameras, sensors, alarms, lighting,
              barriers, and visitor-flow control.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong>human subsystem</strong> includes:
              security guards, engineers, curators, and people who design the visitor space.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All components must work together to satisfy requirements like
            <strong>security</strong>, <strong>conservation</strong>,
            <strong>comfort</strong>, and <strong>accessibility</strong>.
            This is a perfect example of how systems engineers think:
            define the mission, identify stakeholders, extract requirements,
            and design a coherent architecture.
