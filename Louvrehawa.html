          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              <strong>The Raft of the Medusa</strong> is displayed in the
              <strong>Denon Wing</strong> of the Louvre, on
              <strong>Level 1</strong>, in <strong>Room 700 (Salle Mollien)</strong>,
              in the French Romantic painting section.
            </p>
            <p>
              The canvas is enormous: about <strong>4.91 m high</strong> and
              <strong>7.16 m wide</strong>. When visitors enter the room, the
              painting dominates the space like a giant screen, which makes the
              tragedy even more impressive.

        <details>
          <summary>❓ Question 2: What real event inspired this painting?</summary>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              The painting is based on the <strong>shipwreck of the French frigate
              Méduse</strong> in <strong>1816</strong>, near the coast of
              present-day Mauritania, on the way to Senegal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of poor navigation and bad decisions, the ship ran
              aground. A large group of people were placed on a
              <strong>makeshift wooden raft</strong>. About <strong>147</strong>
              people started on the raft; after <strong>13 days</strong> at sea,
              only <strong>15 survived</strong>, after hunger, thirst, madness and
              even cannibalism. The scandal shocked France and became a symbol
              of political incompetence.

          <summary>❓ Question 3: How did Géricault prepare this painting?</summary>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Géricault worked almost like an <strong>investigator</strong> or an
              <strong>engineer</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>He interviewed survivors such as Savigny (the doctor) and Corréard (the engineer).</li>
              <li>He read official reports and newspapers about the disaster.</li>
              <li>He built a <strong>scale model of the raft</strong> to study its structure.</li>
              <li>He observed dead bodies in hospitals to paint the anatomy realistically.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              He combined all this information to design a composition that is
              both historically based and visually powerful.

      <div class="card">
        <details>
          <summary>❓ Question 4: What moment of the story is shown in the painting?</summary>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              The scene shows the moment when the survivors finally see a
              <strong>rescue ship</strong> on the horizon and try to signal it.
              Some men wave pieces of cloth, others stand up and stretch their
              arms toward the tiny ship in the distance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The composition is built like a <strong>double pyramid</strong>:
              dead bodies in the foreground form the base, while the group of
              men climbing toward the top expresses <strong>hope</strong>. At the
              same time, the dark sea and sky keep the feeling of
              <strong>danger</strong> and instability.

      <!-- Q5: Systems engineering – failure -->
      <div class="card">
        <details>
          <summary>❓ Question 5: How can we see this story as a system failure?</summary>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              From a <strong>systems engineering</strong> point of view, the
              Méduse is a complete <strong>system breakdown</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Poor leadership:</strong> an inexperienced captain was
                chosen for political reasons, not for competence.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bad risk management:</strong> navigation errors and no
                proper contingency plan for a shipwreck.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Inadequate resources:</strong> the raft was badly
                designed, overloaded and had almost no food or water.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ethical collapse:</strong> the crew abandoned people on
                the raft to save themselves.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The catastrophe is not just “bad luck”; it is the consequence of
              a series of <strong>design and decision failures</strong> in the
              whole socio-technical system.

      <!-- Q6: Subsystems & mission -->
      <div class="card">
        <details>
          <summary>❓ Question 6: What subsystems and mission can we identify?</summary>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              We can describe the situation using typical systems engineering
              concepts:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mission:</strong> transport people safely from France to
                Senegal.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Human subsystem:</strong> officers, sailors, soldiers,
                passengers, plus their skills, decisions and behaviors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Technical subsystem:</strong> the ship, the emergency
                boats, and finally the <strong>raft</strong> (structure, ropes,
                mast, sails).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Environmental subsystem:</strong> ocean, weather,
                currents, visibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Management & governance subsystem:</strong> the Navy,
                political decisions, rules for safety and evacuation.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The painting shows what happens when these subsystems are not
              correctly designed, coordinated or controlled. It is a visual
              case study of a <strong>failed complex system</strong>.
